\prefacesection{Abstract}
This document is a thesis on the subject of single-agent
on-line path planning in continuous,unpredictable and highly dynamic
environments. The problem is finding and traversing a collision-free path
for a holonomic robot,
without kinodynamic restrictions, moving in an environment with several
unpredictably moving obstacles or adversaries.
The availability of perfect information of the environment at all times is
assumed.

Several static and dynamic variants of the Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT)
algorithm are explored, as well as an evolutionary algorithm for planning in
dynamic environments called the Evolutionary Planner/Navigator. A combination of
both kinds of algorithms is proposed to overcome shortcomings in both, and then
a combination of a RRT variant for initial planning and informed local search for
navigation, plus a simple greedy heuristic for optimization.
We show that this combination of simple techniques provides
better responses to highly dynamic environments than the RRT extensions.
%Also
%proposed is the construction of a path planning testing framework, and its use
%for comparing previously uncompared algorithms.

\textbf{Keywords:} Artificial intelligence, motion planning, RRT, Multi-stage,
informed local search, greedy heuristics, evolutionary algorithms
